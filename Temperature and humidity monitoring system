📝 1. Project Description

This project is a real-time Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System made using Arduino UNO, DHT11 sensor, and a 16×2 I2C LCD.
The sensor reads environmental temperature and humidity, the Arduino processes the data, and the values are displayed on the LCD screen continuously.
It is simple, reliable, and ideal for learning sensor interfacing and microcontroller programming.
